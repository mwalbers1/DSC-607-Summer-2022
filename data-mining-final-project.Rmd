## Project Overview

Perform Market Basket Analysis on US Census data to extract patterns and associations from demographic data for New York state.



## Research Question

Identify specific patterns and segments of the New York state population for post COVID-19 risk factors such as job loss, stress, anxiety, and depression.



## Data Set

The American Community Survey known as ACS is a part of the US Census Bureau which conducts annual surveys of three million people throughout the United States. The data set consists of the ACS 2019 one-year estimates for social and economic characteristics, and the 2020 5-year estimates for demographic and housing data for New York state.  The ACS estimates are within the 90% confidence interval.



### ACS Data Files

- DP02 Social Characteristics

- DP03 Economic Characteristics

- DP05 Demographic and Housing Characteristics



## Data Preprocessing


### Alteryx Process

![Alteryx Workflow](resources/alteryx-acs-workflow.png)



An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow was created using Alteryx Designer. The workflow performs the following tasks for each of the three ACS files:

1 - Download CSV file

2 - Filter records to exclude grand totals

3 - Clean numeric cells by removing spaces, punctuation, and characters

4 - Rename columns


After each CSV file is cleaned, then they are merged into a single CSV file which is used for creating the market basket CSV file. The data values are then scaled to be in thousands (1,000s).



## Exploratory Data Analysis

Check for outliers and skewness in the data set which could impact the Market Basket Analysis
