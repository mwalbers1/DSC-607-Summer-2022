## Overview

1. Create Decision Tree and KNN classifiers on a data set without cross validation. 

2. Then using cross-validation create classification decision tree and KNN models on same data set.  

Compare results between first two cases:

- Which classifier was more accurate?

- Which strategy performed best? cross-validation or without cross-validation?

- What statistic was used to compare performance
